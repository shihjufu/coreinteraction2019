		<div class="content_flightht_travel_dil">
			My grandma is one of the most important person in my life. My grandparents raised me since I was born til 3rd grade of elementary school, and I have spent all of my childhood with her, which she is someone that I have the closest bond within my family. Now that I have moved away from home, I miss her every single day, and the sad thing is she is not very good with technology, so whenever she wants to talk to me she’d have to go to my grandpa and my mom to ask for help, and she doesn’t call me that often because she doesn’t want to annoy me, but I have told her many times, if it is a call from her, It doesn’t matter what I am doing, I will always pick up and it will make my day,

		<div class="content_flightht_travel_dil">
			Ben is my best friend, I met him during the Middle East Studies course during NYU precollege in 2016. We didn’t talk to each other at the start and I seriously embarrassed myself in front of the whole class. And I dropped the class, until a week later it turned out another friend I had in the program was his roommate, we went to coney island together and we were best friends ever since.

		<div class="content_flightht_travel_dil">
			My dog has been with me since I was in 7th grade. I’ve wanted a pet dog forever and since my brother I wasn’t able to when I was really young. 7th grade was also one of the worst year of my life because I was bullied extremely in school, which I was too afraid to tell my parents, so when I got home I could only talk to my dog and cuddle her when I needed help. She has stuck with me ever since and whenever I am home she will not leave my side. She will always come ask me for food, wake me up in the morning because she is hungry and wants a walk, but I know she knows I love her so much so she just come annoy me till I do what she wants.
