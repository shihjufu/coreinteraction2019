   	<br>"... a young artist who doesnâ€™t have a website is no artist"<br><br>

   	The internet really had it's influence in the art industry and changing the way people view many things, including art. Art is so accessable because of the internet. On social media, lots of artists uses it as a platform to promote themself. Is it really nessesary for artists to have a website or showcasing their work on instagram enough? I feel like rather than using a website to showcase or exhibit their work, artisits can also incorporate their website into a sort of artwork.
