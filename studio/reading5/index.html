   	<br>"The QuarkExpress file is stored on a 44 MB SyQuest cartridge which I still own, but the contents of which I can no longer access. The handmade website, on the other hand, is still online and it still works."<br><br>

   	The internet can allow easy access to information that might be unaccessible through time, or allows a wider audience to access certain information in a much easier and convenient process.

   	<br><br>Many people nowadays uses social media and uses it as way to host our online identity. I do so myself because for me personally, it is rather unnecessary to maintain and update a personal website which will entail lots of work, which like the passage has mentioned a "handmade web" takes a lot of work to maintain. While putting into the hard work, thats where I'll probably have less interaction with anyone compared to social media since it is a platform where lots of people approve of and has joined and allows more social interaction than a website.
