      <p>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radii, and color.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The box-shadow property enables you to cast a drop shadow from the frame of almost any element.If a border-radius is specified on the element with a box shadow, the box shadow takes on the same rounded corners.The z-ordering of multiple box shadows is the same as multiple text shadows (the first specified shadow is on top).</p>
